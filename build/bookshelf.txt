It's a shelf full of books!
Here's Fifty shades of gray
and all of your textbooks
*throws away all of that trash*
Hey, here are some good books!
The Mistborn Series
Comics
etc.
Hey, wait a minute...
Is there a lever hidden behind this shelf?
Nope, lol that would be hard to program
Man you really have been here a while
Why are you looking at books?
Alana what are you doing?

I hope you're having a truly, truly great early birthday.
We all had a blast setting it up.

And get on with the games
