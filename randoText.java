/* Yo mariah, tell me what you think about this idea.  
 * 
 * I'm working on a jank pokemon program that we can throw together for Alana's 
 * birthday party.  
 * I think we could pokemonize everyone in the hall and make them battle her 
 * team.  I can program the battle logic, movesets, and everything, 
 * i just need the images and stuff for everyone.  Think this sounds fun?  
 * We could even find the pokemon soundtrack and everything.  In theory we 
 * could have the game take a tour down the hall and have her battle everyone, 
 * alternatively we could pokemonize her chem professors and have her SLAY haha.  
 * I think i'll be able to have the battle interface down by the end of the 
 * weekend, especially if i focus on it Saturday.
