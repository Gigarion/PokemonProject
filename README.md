# PokemonProject
Basic pokemon game building kit that will allow for custom battles, pokemon, etc.  I'm building on a specific scenario (Birthday present for a friend) and all files here are related to that, but could easily be adapted for individual projects.

This project took exactly a month to put into its current state, i'd love to revisit and rework it sometime.

## Compilation and Running
<ul>
<li> compile: javac */java -d bin (hope your classpath includes bin lol)
<li> run: java HBA
</ul>

## Features (in general):

You can run around the map, fight and catch most of the pokemon (my freshman hallmates :D), and the guy at the top center is kind of a boss. 

PC system works, just catch more than 6 pokemon and you should have interactivity there.

Every time you restart the game, it puts you at the start location, resets the items in your pack and makes everything catcheable/fightable again.  You'd have to clear some of the files in the data folder to actually reset (just redownload the repo honestly).

## The controls are:
<ul> 
  <li>Terrible, have to pick better buttons
  <li>Movement: wasd
  <li>Interact/action: space
  <li>Go back: b
  <li>Open menu; p (why???)
</ul>

If anyone actually wants to use this as a framework, send me a shoutout and we can figure out how to make something cool :D.
