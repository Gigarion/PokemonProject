# PokemonProject
Basic pokemon game building kit that will allow for custom battles, pokemon, etc.  I'm building on a specific scenario (Birthday present for a friend) and all files here are related to that, but could easily be adapted for individual projects.

This project took exactly a month to put into its current state, i'd love to revisit and rework it sometime.
You can run around the map, fight and catch most of the pokemon (my freshman hallmates :D), and the guy at the top center is kind of a boss. 

PC system works.

Every time you restart the game, it resets the items in your pack and makes everything catcheable/fightable again.  You'd have to clear some of the files in the data folder to actually reset (just redownload the repo honestly).

## The controls are:
<ul> 
  <li>Terrible, have to pick better buttons
  <li>Movement: wasd
  <li>Interact/action: space
  <li>Go back: b
  <li>Open menu; p (why???)
</ul>

If anyone actually wants to use this as a framework, send me a shoutout and we can figure out how to make something cool :D.
